All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.0.1] - 2026-04-03

### Fixed
- Fixed frontend JSON parsing failures by surfacing non-JSON API responses with clearer diagnostics across activity, analytics, saved views, and export requests
- Fixed Alpine.js null-handling issues when switching between table and timeline views
- Fixed custom properties rendering when `activity.properties` is null in the timeline and activity detail modal
- Fixed missing favicon 404s by only rendering favicon links when published assets are available

## [2.0.0] - 2026-04-03

### Breaking Changes
- Requires PHP 8.4+, Laravel 12+, and Spatie laravel-activitylog v5
- Batch UUID feature removed entirely (Spatie v5 removes batch system)
- Activity attribute changes now read from `attribute_changes` column instead of `properties`
- `hasPropertyChanges()` deprecated in favor of `hasAttributeChanges()`

### Changed
- Properties column in UI now shows only custom data; attribute changes displayed separately
- Timeline view and detail modal now show "Attribute Changes" and "Custom Properties" as distinct sections
- Search now covers `attribute_changes` column in addition to `properties` and `description`
- Export JSON output now includes `attribute_changes` field
- Schema column check now uses the model's database connection instead of the default connection

### Added
- `restored` event color in analytics chart defaults
- Separate "Attribute Changes" display section in activity detail modal
- Separate "Custom Properties" display section in timeline and detail views
- Legacy fallback: `hasAttributeChanges()` and `getFormattedChangesAttribute()` fall back to `properties.old`/`properties.attributes` for unmigrated rows
- Frontend legacy fallback: timeline and detail modal resolve changes from `attribute_changes` or `properties` transparently
- Legacy diff keys (`old`, `attributes`) are filtered from the Custom Properties panel to prevent duplication

### Removed
- Batch UUID filter from filter panel, table view, and all JavaScript state management
- `FiltersBatchUuid` trait
- `sanitizeUuid()` method from controller
